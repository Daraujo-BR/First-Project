# First Project
Hello readers! Hope you guys are fine! That's my first project in Github! 
The idea of this project is to update the project while i'm improving in studies of computer languages, that by doing a simple program.
Those updates will be based in languages I'm studying or have already studied.

The following computer languages are in the project now:
- Python
- JavaScript
